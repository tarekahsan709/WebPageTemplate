      <h2>Artist's Gallery</h2>
      <p>The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in participating in the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. In addition, nine individuals are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces. Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at the conference to share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with conference attendees. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>

      <h3>Barot Bellingham</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p><img src="img/bell.jpg" alt="" class="pull-right">Barot has just finished his final year at The Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, where he excelled in glass etching paintings and portraiture. Hailed as one of the most diverse artists of his generation, Barot is equally as skilled with watercolors as he is with oils, and is just as well-balanced in different subject areas. Barot’s collection entitled "The Un-Collection" will adorn the walls of Gilbert Hall, depicting his range of skills and sensibilities - all of them, uniquely Barot, yet undeniably different.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p><img src="img/jer.jpg" alt="" class="pull-right">A native of New Orleans, much of Jennifer’s work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, having grown up as a teenager in the post-flood years. Despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost, Jennifer’s work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered. Jennifer’s exhibit will be discussed during Tuesday’s Water in Art theme.</p>

Riley’s exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind’s eye. Riley will be speaking on the “Art of Abstract” during Thursday’s schedule.</p>
